To determine our strategy for preparing for a software enginering position, let's flip the roles. Imagine we're in charge of hiring engineers to develop a new app. The cost of hiring, training, and firing a bad engineer can take ~6 months and $100,000, so it's also important to avoid any bad engineers. **How would we interview and screen for good software engineer?**

Ideally, we would look for engineers who are capable of completing the work. We would look for on their resume for a history of demonstrating skills through either work experience or side projects.

However, people can lie on their resume. To screen for this, we can devise coding challenges. What should the coding challenges cover? Well, most engineers study data structures and algorithms as their foundation. So, we could create coding questions covering data structures and algorithms ("Leetcode").

Now, data structures and algorithms are a limited part of an good software engineer's education. We should probably also ask questions on other topics such as system design, operating systems, networking, and cloud computing.

Lastly, someone can be a technical whiz but terrible to work with. To screen for an amicable co-worker, we could ask behavorial questions about how the applicant would respond in various scenarios. 

From flipping the roles from applicant to interviewer, we can now understand what the interviwer look for. A good applicant has the following traits:
* resume with a track record of building things
* ability to solve data structures and algorithms questions
* knowledge of various topics such as system design, operating systems, networking, and cloud computing
* soft skills to be a good co-worker 

In summary, the most important things one should obtain are a track record, skills, and knowledge to be a great applicant for software engineer positions. Thankfully, the latter two are important for being an engineer which you should already be working towards.
