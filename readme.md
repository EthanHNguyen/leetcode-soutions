# Leetcode Solutions
As of January 2024, layoffs are abound in the tech industry. Out of caution, I am keeping my interviewing skills sharp. Also, practicing data structure and algorithms is fun when you're not actually preparing for an interview. 

This repo contains my explanation of various coding problems on [leetcode.com](https://www.leetcode.com). By posting my explanations, I hope to remember the solutions better and perhaps help anyone else applying for software engineering positions.
